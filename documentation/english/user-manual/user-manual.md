## Introduction: welcome to the DyrBok app

We are very happy that you want to use the DyrBok app! (DyrBok is Norwegian for animal book.) With this app you can view photos of our shelter animals and share your photos with all volunteers and employees of Dierentehuis Stevenshage. You can also read the descriptions of the animals and see which animals have been reserved or adopted. If you share photos, they may also be used for the [website](https://www.dierenasielleiden.nl/), the Beestenbende magazine and other forms of communication of Dierentehuis Stevenshage.

The background information, adoption status and photos of the shelter animals are copied from the [website](https://www.dierenasielleiden.nl/). Normally you will see new shelter animals in the app within one day.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the app or this manual, please contact us by email: dyrbok.24@gmail.com.

## Login
You can log in with your Google/Gmail account. The first time you use the app, you will be given the opportunity to ask for access to the app. One of the application administrators will then check whether you work for Dierentehuis Stevenshage. After approval, logging in will be automatic.

## Home screen
After logging in, you will arrive at the home screen:

Here you can choose one of the five animal species: dog, cats, rabbits, rodents or birds. You can also use the button at the bottom to view information about the app.

## Screen with shelter animals of one species

After choosing one of the five animal species, you will see a list of shelter animals of this species.

The buttons of the animals have different colors:
- blue for available animals;
- green for available animals for which we can still use photos (icon: camera);
- orange for reserved animals (icon: house with question mark) and
- red for adopted animals (icon: house).

## Screen with a shelter animal and photos

By selecting one of the shelter animals, you will enter the screen with photos of this animal (or sometimes a number of related animals):

With the plus button at the bottom right, you can optionally add your own photos of this shelter animal. If you click on the button with the name of the animal, you will see the description of this animal.

## Screen with the description of a shelter animal

In this screen you can read the description of the shelter animal:

The DyrBok app is available in several languages. Only the description of the shelter animals is not yet automatically translated and is only available in Dutch. On the [website](https://www.dierenasielleiden.nl/) you can find translated versions of the descriptions.

## Games

If you click on the Quiz button at the top of the screen with the shelter animals of one species, you will enter the quiz:

<img alt="Screen with quiz from name to photos." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artemo24/DyrBok/main/documentation/english/user-manual/animals-quiz-1a.png" width="672">

In the quiz you will see one name and four photos. Click on the correct photo and you will get four points. After two correct answers in a row you will see six photos and you will also get six points per correct answer. After two incorrect answers in a row, the number of photos is reduced by two.

After clicking on one of the photos, the correct photo gets a green border and the other photos get a red border:

By clicking on one of the photos again, you will see the next quiz question.

By clicking on the score at the top of the screen, you can play an alternative version of the quiz:

Now you will see one photo and a number of names. Click on the correct name to earn points. After clicking on one of the names, the correct name gets a green border and the other names get a red border:
